## 🧪 Task 3: Basic Vulnerability Scan on Local Machine

### 🎯 Objective  
Perform a basic vulnerability scan using **Nessus Essentials** to identify vulnerabilities on your personal system. Understand their risk levels using CVSS scores, and research potential fixes or mitigation techniques.

---

### 🧰 Tools Used  
- **Nessus Essentials** (Free version by Tenable)  
- **Operating System**: Windows 11 (Virtual Machine)  
- **Target**: Localhost IP (`127.0.0.1`)  

---

### 📝 What I Did

1. Installed and configured Nessus Essentials with the activation key.
2. Created a **Host Discovery Scan** targeting my own machine (`127.0.0.1`).
3. Launched a full scan and waited ~30–45 minutes for it to complete.
4. Analyzed the vulnerability report and identified key findings:
   - SMBv1 protocol enabled
   - OpenSSH user enumeration
5. Researched each vulnerability to understand potential risks and fixes.
6. Took relevant screenshots and exported the scan results in `.nessus` format.
7. Compiled a detailed report and created a GitHub repository for submission.

### 🔐 Top Vulnerabilities Identified

| Vulnerability | CVSS Score | Risk Summary | Fix/Recommendation |
|---------------|-------------|---------------|---------------------|
| SMBv1 Enabled | 9.8 (Critical) | Legacy protocol vulnerable to ransomware attacks (e.g., WannaCry) | Disable via Windows Features or Registry |
| OpenSSH User Enumeration | 7.5 (High) | Allows attacker to detect valid usernames via SSH error messages | Patch OpenSSH and configure `sshd_config` to reduce verbosity |

### 🧠 Reflection Questions Answered

- **What is vulnerability scanning and how does it work?**  
  → It is an automated process to identify known weaknesses and security flaws in a system.

- **How is vulnerability scanning different from penetration testing?**  
  → Scanning is passive and non-intrusive, while penetration testing simulates real attacks.

- **What is CVSS and how does it help?**  
  → CVSS gives a standardized score (0–10) to rank vulnerability severity and prioritize fixes.

- **What are common vulnerabilities on personal computers?**  
  → Outdated services (SMBv1), SSH misconfigurations, open ports, weak passwords.

- **How do you prioritize vulnerabilities?**  
  → Based on CVSS score, exposure, potential damage, and exploit availability.
