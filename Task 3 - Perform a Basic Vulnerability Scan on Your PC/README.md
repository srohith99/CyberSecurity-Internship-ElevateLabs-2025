# 🔍 Basic Vulnerability Scan – Cyber Security Internship

## 🎯 Objective
Perform a basic vulnerability scan on a local Windows machine using **Tenable Nessus Essentials**, and identify common security risks. This task builds foundational understanding of vulnerability scanning, CVSS scoring, and remediation practices.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **Nessus Essentials** *(Free version by Tenable)*
- **Windows 11 Virtual Machine**
- **Scan Target**: `127.0.0.1` (localhost)

---

## 🛠 Steps Performed

1. Downloaded and installed Nessus Essentials.
2. Registered and activated using the Tenable-provided activation key.
3. Performed plugin sync and tool initialization.
4. Created a **Host Discovery Scan** targeting my local IP `127.0.0.1`.
5. Executed a full scan and waited for completion (~30–45 minutes).
6. Reviewed and documented the vulnerability report.
7. Took screenshots and exported results.

## ⚙️ Scan Configuration

- **Scan Template**: Basic Network Scan  
- **Port Scanning**: Enabled (default settings)  
- **Credentials**: None (Unauthenticated scan)  
- **Scan Duration**: ~30–45 minutes  
- **Exported Format**: `.nessus` file

---

## 🔐 Notable Vulnerabilities Found

### 1. **SMBv1 Protocol Enabled**
- **CVSS Score**: 9.8 (Critical)
- **Risk**: Legacy protocol exploited by ransomware like WannaCry.
- **Fix**: Disable via *Control Panel → Turn Windows Features On/Off* or via *Registry Editor*.

### 2. **OpenSSH User Enumeration**
- **CVSS Score**: 7.5 (High)
- **Risk**: Allows attackers to detect valid usernames via SSH responses.
- **Fix**: Update OpenSSH and modify `sshd_config` settings to reduce verbosity.

## 📈 Learning Outcomes

- Understood the scanning process using Nessus.
- Gained hands-on experience in identifying and prioritizing vulnerabilities.
- Learned how to interpret CVSS scores and apply mitigations.
- Explored unauthenticated vs. authenticated scans and their limitations.

## ❓ Q&A Summary

| Question | Answer |
|---------|--------|
| **What is vulnerability scanning?** | Automated detection of known security flaws. |
| **How is it different from penetration testing?** | Scanning is passive, while pentesting is active exploitation. |
| **What is CVSS?** | A scoring system (0–10) for vulnerability severity. |
| **What are false positives?** | Incorrectly flagged issues that aren't real threats. |
| **How do scanners detect vulnerabilities?** | Using plugins, CVEs, and system banner checks. |
| **How often should scans be performed?** | Monthly or after major updates. |
| **How are vulnerabilities prioritized?** | Based on CVSS score, exposure, impact, and asset value. |
